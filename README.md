# A2: Photo Editor \[Jeremy Cao\]

## Overview

I built a simple photo editor! It can add text to the photo and rotate the photo with 90 degrees.

## Using the app 

User is able to use either CameraX to take a photo or insert a photo from the gallery then have two simple functions to edit the photo. Once finish editing, user
is able save the photo to the phone gallery.
